What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git creates the .git directory containing its internal structures. This
    is needed, as it is the place where git keeps information about the files
    it is tracking, their history, commits, and all other git objects.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area stores files and state that will go into the next commit.
    It is different from the repository in that it can still change and those
    changes will not be part of the history. Further changes to the working
    directory will not affect the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
