When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my repository with other people, be it publicly or privately.
    Also, I might want to do it to have a remote backup, in case my local repo is lost
    for some reason: hard drive failure, human error, theft, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I might not be ready to receive changes at random moments. I might
    want to have a work unit completed and commited before I want to pull
    new code or changes to code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: when I want to extend or modify a existing project, and then publish
    it without having my changes pushed to the original repository.
    Clone: when I want to contribute changes to the original repository.
    Branches: when I start a new unit of work in a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Running git fetch origin, allows me to review changes that have been pushed
    since I last pulled. I can then decide offline what I want to do. After
    that, the local copy allows me to work offline, making changes and merging
    branches if necessary.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    My work happens on dedicated branches. When the work is done and is ready
    to be merged into master, I can do it myself using git. But if I want
    someone else to review it first, make suggestions on just share knowledge,
    I would create a pull request.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
