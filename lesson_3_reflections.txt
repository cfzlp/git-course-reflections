When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my repository with other people, be it publicly or privately.
    Also, I might want to do it to have a remote backup, in case my local repo is lost
    for some reason: hard drive failure, human error, theft, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I might not be ready to receive changes at random moments. I might
    want to have a work unit completed and commited before I want to pull
    new code or changes to code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: when I want to extend or modify a existing project, and then publish
    it without having my changes pushed to the original repository.
    Clone: when I want to contribute changes to the original repository.
    Branches: when I start a new unit of work in a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Running git fetch origin, allows me to review changes that have been pushed
    since I last pulled. I can then decide offline what I want to do. After
    that, the local copy allows me to work offline, making changes and merging
    branches if necessary.
